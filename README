To clone my application, the URL for my application from my github account will be needed, so go to my account (username: philp92) and into the repository placement-assignment, and copy the URL found there.

In the terminal (with grails version 2.0.3 installed) enter the command git clone <URL of application>

Then to actually clone it, enter ls â€“la

Once cloned, enter into the top directory using cd placement-assignment

If you now enter ls you should see that there is only a readme file. This is because I created my application on a separate develop branch, so you will have to checkout that with git checkout develop

You can now enter the project directory with cd Placement and run the application.
